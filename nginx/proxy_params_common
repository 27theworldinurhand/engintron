# By default, Nginx will redirect requests to the right domain IP.
# However in certain cases (e.g. when a domain has not yet resolved to your server,
# but you can access it by modifying your computer's "hosts" file) you may want to set
# the IP for a given domain only manually. Uncomment the following 3 lines and set
# your domain and IP.
#if ($host ~ "example.com") {
#	set $PROXY_DOMAIN_OR_IP "XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX";
#}

# If you wish to use CloudFlare for any of your sites, you will have
# to provide your cPanel's shared IP address below otherwise you'll get errors.
# It is also important to uncomment the 3-line section lower (look at "CloudFlare Headers")
# so CloudFlare visitor IPs are properly passed on to Apache via Nginx.
# You will also need to execute a sed command via SSH as root to enable proper logging in Apache.
